### What is Capoeira?

Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art, dance and music. It looks like this:

It's mostly non-contact, a friendly game to build strength, flexibility and
have fun.

In the broader perspective, Capoeira is a social movement for freedom. Read
the [Capoeira Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira) to
learn more about its history. It became popular when Mestre Bimba introduced
elements of other martial arts and opened a public Capoeira school. Others
prefer to keep it traditional and refer to the old style as Capoeira Angola.
And that is the style we are practising in Newstead today.

### Where are other groups?

To the best of my knowledge, the next Capoeira groups outside of Newstead are
[in Melbourne](https://capoeira-melbourne.github.io/).
