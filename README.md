### What is Capoeira?

Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art, dance and music. It looks like this:

It's mostly non-contact, a friendly game to build strength, flexibility and
have fun.

In the broader perspective, Capoeira is a social movement for freedom.
It was developed by the enslaved Africans in Brazil and is now practiced all
around the world. Read
the [Capoeira Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira) to
learn more about its history.
We practise the traditional version, Capoeira Angola.

### The training

Everybody is welcome to train with us. There is no set term schedule and you
can start at any time. We do a good warm-up, learn a few Capoeira moves and
then play as much as time and skill permits.

We focus on movements because we don't have any musical instruments at the
moment. The style of Capoeira Angola is to learn movements in little steps,
first slow and small until you have the strength and precision to control the
movement at faster speeds.

You don't need to be very fit to learn Capoeira. Building strength is part of
the training. Just drop in and see if you like it. The first session is always
free. After that, a little contribution towards the room rent would be nice
(up to $5 depending on the number of people).

### Who is running this?

The group was started by Maikel Linke. He discovered Capoeira at university in
Germany. That was in 2005 and it has become his favourite exercise since. After
moving to regional Victoria, it was a challenge to visit classes in Melbourne
regularly. So here it is, a local meet-up to continue the practise and build
community.

### Where are other groups?

To the best of our knowledge, the next Capoeira groups outside of Newstead are
[in Melbourne](https://capoeira-melbourne.github.io/).
